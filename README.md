## Intermediate Meteor Recipe Application

Created following Level Up's [intermediate Meteor tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHFYZUSK62aVycgcAouqBt7V)

I chose to place the index.html and other client files all in the client/ folder.

To test, clone or download and install dependencies:

`$ meteor npm install --save babel-runtime`

`$ meteor npm install --save babel-runtime`

`$ meteor` in the project's home directory and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
